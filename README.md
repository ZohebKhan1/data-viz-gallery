# Data visualization gallery made with ggplot2 

Data visualization is, in my opinion, an underappreciated skill in the bioinformatics field. Pretty/aesthetically-pleasing figures will never turn bad data into good data, but they can definitely already-good-data to something even better.

This gallery contains a variety of visualizations that I have created for various 'omics analyses (RNA/ChIP/ATACseq), but the majority of these figures can be adapted to completely different data modalities. 

All code used to generate figures shown in this gallery can be found in this repository.

Please e-mail zohebk@uchicago.edu for any questions or suggestions regarding these figures.
